# GikFun-LED-Chaser-RE

### Purpose
I am testing to make sure my process of making schematic and then PCB and such is working.  I should be able to just use the solder practice kit 1:1 and it should work the same.

### Files:
The schematic, netlist, and PCB are all here.  I will update the ReadMe if it works.  I'm waiting on the order from osh park rn.

The one modification is that I am using a different power socket since the one they use is really obscure and I only found it in one place.  This one is meant to use the following receptacle:  https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/710-694106301002

Can be powered with any 2.1 x 5.5 5V DC barrel.
